README
	*********************
	This folder contains all files needed to run the code required for Assingment Two for Coding for Social Scientists GEOG5995.
	The only files that need to be opened and run are;
		- drunkagentclass.py
		- drunks.py

	The three CSV files contain environment data that the agents interact with. drunkfinal.csv and aftermovement.csv are the files that are read into the programme and as such contain environment data and information before agent interaction.
	The file densitymap.csv is the file can be opened after running the programme and will show and updated environment data file, each point will have been raised by one value each time an agent stands on this	.

	To run the model first run drunkagentclass.py followed by drunks.py. The final model produces a range of visual outputs and the number of steps each agent takes to find the correct home.
	**********************

	Documentation is included;
		-UML Code Flow diagram in PDF and PNG formats
		-Supporting Document further discussing project development.
